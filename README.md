This github repository contains notes about my Mendix journey.

4. Azure Sentinel with Mendix Applications: Custom analytics rules and automation rules

### First impression
A week ago I started my Mendix journey and got a first, very good impression using the Mendix academy entry-level program academy.mendix.com and the docs at docs.mendix.com.
Similar to Microsoft Visual Studio, the Mendix Studio Pro is a quite powerful IDE to develop apps. Beside Studio, there is the Mendix Marketplace with plenty of subcomponents useful for rapid application development. Also, on https://github.com/mendix there are additional tools like buildpacks for docker, cli, etc.

Mendix as a Siemens company has strategic partnerships with SAP and AWS, see https://docs.mendix.com/partners. In Switzerland there is a well-known Mendix partner called Plain IT helping customers. 

One main topic is cybersecurity. How to ensure the management of operational risks and the safeguarding of operational resilience? Thinking in terms of product interoperability, marketplace subcomponents, sbom, security advisories, etc.
See https://docs.mendix.com/releasenotes/security-advisories/ and https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-20544/Mendix.html .
